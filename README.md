# ðŸ”Š Voice-Controlled LED Automation
A basic voice-controlled home automation system to turn ON or OFF up to four LEDs using voice commands. <br>This project is ideal for beginners learning about speech recognition and microcontroller integration.<br> <br> 

# ðŸŽ¯ Features
Voice commands to control 4 LEDs

Simple and beginner-friendly C++ + Arduino setup

Offline speech recognition (optional). 


communication between WEB Page and microcontroller (using IP Adderss of microcontroller) <br><br>  


## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
Creat a WEB Page for Speech Recognition and Command Processing

Arduino UNO / ESP32 (for LED control)/Raspberry Pi Picow W  <br>

In my case I use Raspberry Pi Pico W

Connect the Web Page created to the Server of microcontroller   (using IP Adderss of microcontroller)

connect the microcontroller and the device(from which  thw web page is running) with a common WIFI connection

Device should have a stable internet connectivity <br><br>  

# ðŸ“¦ Installation

Upload the code in your Device (HTML file)

Download Arduino IDE (for .ino file) <br>

Connect LEDs
connectv the LED pins with the microcontroller GPIO pins

Remember to update the code as per connections

Use 220Î© resistors for each LED.  <br><br>



#### ðŸŽ¤ Voice Commands  Voice Command	Action

Turn on LED 1	    Turns on LED1

Turn off LED 1	  Turns off LED1

Turn on LED 2    	Turns on LED2

Turn off LED 2	  Turns off LED2

Turn on LED 3    	Turns on LED3

Turn off LED 3	  Turns off LED3

Turn on LED 4    	Turns on LED4

Turn off LED 4  	Turns off LED4

<br><br>

ðŸš€ How to Run
Plug in your Microcontroller
upload the  .ino file in your microcontroller<br>

Run the HTML file:<br>

connect the microcontroller and the device(from which  thw web page is running) with a common wifi connection<br>
Device should have a stable internet connectivity<br><br>

give the voice commad through the Web Page
example voice command:
"Turn on LED 3"
The system recognizes your speech and sends a command to the Microcontroller to toggle the correct pin.
